# FCC NumPy Practice
***Free Code Camp NumPy Project***

# The Project:
After completing the 300 hour Data Analysis With Python Certificantion my first assignment was to create the following;

***"Create a function named calculate() in mean_var_std.py that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.***

***The input of the function should be a list containing 9 digits. The function should convert the list into a 3 x 3 Numpy array, and then return a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix."***

The assignment came with additional instructions that described what the output should look like as well as the error that should display when the function is not performing properly. See the following link for further details: https://repl.it/repls/UnluckyVictoriousDecompiler

# The Process
The way I approached this challenge was by following the steps below:

1. Understand what the challenge is asking me to do
2. Make a list of questions that I have about what i need to complete the challenge
3. Sudo code the function by pieces that respond to each part of the challenge
4. Clean up my code and test it out

# Conclusion
I was able to manipulate numpy arrays by writing a function which in return produced a dictionary of lists. Things I would do differently are, I would spend a little more time gathering information at the beginning so the coding process can go by quicker. I do not expect to memorize all methods and attributes I can use for such a challenge. But I see that with plenty of research in the beginning, I can produce faster results.
