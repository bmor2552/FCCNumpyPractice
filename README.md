# FCC NumPy Practice
***Free Code Camp NumPy Project***

# The Project:
After completing the 300 hour Data Analysis With Python Certificantion my first assignment was to create the following;

***"Create a function named calculate() in mean_var_std.py that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.***

***The input of the function should be a list containing 9 digits. The function should convert the list into a 3 x 3 Numpy array, and then return a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix."***

The assignment came with additional instructions that described what the output should look like as well as the error that should display when the function is not performing properly. See the following link for further details: https://repl.it/repls/UnluckyVictoriousDecompiler
